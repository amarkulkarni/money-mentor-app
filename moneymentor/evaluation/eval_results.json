      "query": "What is compound interest?",
      "expected_answer": "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and accumulated interest",
      "actual_answer": "Compound interest is a powerful financial concept that refers to the way interest is calculated on both the initial principal amount and any interest that has already been added to it. This means that as you earn interest, that interest also begins to earn interest, leading to exponential growth over time.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Principal**: This is the original amount of money you invest or save. For example, let's say you start with $1,000.\n\n2. **Interest Rate**: This is the percentage at which your money grows each year. For instance, if you have an interest rate of 5%, you would earn $50 in interest during the first year (5% of $1,000).\n\n3. **Compounding**: If you leave your money in the account, that interest is added to your principal. So after one year, you would have $1,050 ($1,000 + $50). In the second year, you earn interest on the new total ($1,050), which would be $52.50 (5% of $1,050). Your new balance would then be $1,102.50.\n\n4. **Growth Over Time**: As you continue to leave your money invested and allow it to compound, the amount of interest you earn each year increases. This is because you're earning interest on a larger amount as time goes on.\n\nTo illustrate, if you start saving at a young age and consistently invest, even small amounts can grow significantly over time due to the effect of compound interest. For example, investing $300 per month at a 7% annual return could grow to over $540,000 by the time you retire, simply because of the compounding effect.\n\nIn summary, compound interest is essentially earning \"interest on your interest,\" which can lead to substantial growth in your savings or investments over time!",

      "query": "What is the 50/30/20 budgeting rule?",
      "expected_answer": "The 50/30/20 rule suggests allocating 50% to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings",
      "actual_answer": "The 50/30/20 budgeting rule is a simple and effective way to manage your finances by dividing your after-tax income into three categories: \n\n1. **50% Needs**: Allocate 50% of your income to essential expenses, which include things like housing (rent or mortgage), utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, and any other necessary expenses. These are the things you cannot live without.\n\n2. **30% Wants**: Designate 30% of your income to discretionary spending or \"wants.\" This can include dining out, entertainment, vacations, hobbies, and any other non-essential expenses that enhance your lifestyle.\n\n3. **20% Savings**: Finally, set aside 20% of your income for savings. This could be for retirement accounts, an emergency fund, or other savings goals. The aim is to build financial security and plan for the future.\n\n### Example:\nIf your monthly take-home pay is $3,000:\n- **Needs**: $1,500 (50% of $3,000)\n- **Wants**: $900 (30% of $3,000)\n- **Savings**: $600 (20% of $3,000)\n\nThis rule helps create a balanced budget that allows for both essential living expenses and personal enjoyment, while also ensuring you're saving for the future. It's a great starting point, but remember to adjust the percentages based on your personal financial situation and goals!",

      "query": "Why do I need an emergency fund?",
      "expected_answer": "An emergency fund provides financial security for unexpected expenses",
      "actual_answer": "An emergency fund is essential for several reasons:\n\n1. **Financial Security**: It provides a safety net during unexpected situations, such as job loss, medical emergencies, or urgent home repairs. This peace of mind allows you to navigate financial challenges without added stress.\n\n2. **Avoiding Debt**: When emergencies arise, having funds set aside means you won't have to rely on credit cards or loans, which can lead to high-interest debt. An emergency fund helps you manage these situations without incurring additional financial burdens.\n\n3. **Stability in Budgeting**: Knowing you have an emergency fund allows you to stick to your budget more comfortably. You can allocate funds for savings and flexible expenses without worrying about unplanned costs disrupting your financial plans.\n\n4. **Building Good Financial Habits**: Establishing an emergency fund encourages disciplined saving habits, which can lead to better overall financial management in other areas of your life.\n\nMost experts recommend saving three to six months' worth of essential expenses in your emergency fund. If that seems daunting, start with a smaller goal, like $500, and gradually build from there. This fund should be kept in a separate account that is easily accessible when needed.\n\nIn summary, having an emergency fund is a critical step toward achieving financial stability and security. It prepares you for the unexpected and helps you maintain control of your finances.",
