# MoneyMentor: Final Evaluation Summary & Conclusions

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Evaluation Scope:** Base vs. Hybrid+Rerank Retriever  
**Datasets:** Simple (15 queries), Reasoning (12 queries)  
**Scoring Methods:** Binary, TF-IDF Semantic Similarity

---

## Executive Summary

We conducted comprehensive evaluations comparing Base (vector similarity) and Hybrid+Rerank (BM25 + Vector + Cohere Reranking) retrievers using:
- **Binary scoring** (exact substring matching)
- **Semantic scoring** (TF-IDF cosine similarity)
- **Two datasets** (simple queries + complex reasoning queries)

**Key Finding:** Hybrid+Rerank shows **small quantitative improvements** (+1.1% on complex queries) and **qualitative advantages** in answer comprehensiveness, at a **12.5× cost increase** over Base.

**Recommendation:** Use Base for production, with optional A/B testing of Hybrid+Rerank on complex queries to measure real-world user satisfaction improvements.

## 1. Evaluation Methodology

### 1.1 Datasets

| Dataset | Queries | Type | Example |
|---------|---------|------|---------|
| **Simple** | 15 | Single-concept lookups | "What is compound interest?" |
| **Reasoning** | 12 | Multi-hop, comparative | "Compare traditional IRA vs Roth IRA..." |

### 1.2 Scoring Methods

**Binary Scoring:**
- Exact substring match between generated and expected answers
- `1.0` if expected string appears in generated answer, else `0.0`
- **Limitation:** Misses semantic equivalence (paraphrasing)

**TF-IDF Semantic Scoring:**
- Cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors
- Returns `0.0-1.0` based on word overlap and frequency
- **Advantage:** Captures semantic similarity without exact matches
- **Limitation:** Less sophisticated than transformer embeddings

### 1.3 Metrics

- **Faithfulness:** Does generated answer match expected answer?
- **Relevancy:** Does generated answer address the query?
- **Precision:** Are retrieved contexts relevant to expected answer?
- **Recall:** Do contexts contain information needed for answer?

**Quality Improvement:** +1.1% (on complex queries only)  
**ROI:** **Low** - $760K per 1% improvement

**Conclusion:** Cost increase not justified by quantitative improvement alone. Decision depends on:
1. User satisfaction improvement (not measured)
2. Task completion rate improvement (not measured)
3. Business value of complex query quality

---

## 4. Qualitative Analysis

While quantitative metrics show minimal differences, **manual inspection reveals qualitative improvements:**

### 4.1 Sample Query: "Compare traditional IRA vs Roth IRA"

**Base Retriever Context:**
1. ✅ General retirement account overview
2. ✅ Tax concepts (deferred vs. tax-free)
3. ⚠️ Generic investment advice (less relevant)
4. ⚠️ Compound interest discussion (not IRA-specific)
5. ✅ Contribution limits

**Hybrid+Rerank Context:**
1. ✅ Direct IRA comparison section
2. ✅ Detailed tax implications
3. ✅ When to choose each type
4. ✅ Income considerations
5. ✅ Withdrawal rules comparison

**Generated Answer Quality:**
- **Base:** Correct but includes tangential information
- **Hybrid+Rerank:** More focused, directly addresses comparison
- **Both achieve 1.0 relevance** (answer the question)
- **Hybrid+Rerank more comprehensive** (not captured by metrics)

### 4.2 Why Metrics Miss Quality Differences

1. **LLM paraphrasing:** GPT-4o-mini naturally restates concepts, breaking exact matches
2. **Document-level metrics:** Precision/Recall measure entire documents, not sentence-level relevance
3. **TF-IDF limitations:** Misses semantic nuance captured by transformer models
4. **No comprehensiveness metric:** Doesn't measure whether all aspects of query are covered

### 5.3 Measurement Challenges

**Binary Scoring:**
- ❌ Too strict (exact substring match)
- ❌ Misses semantic equivalence
- ✅ Easy to implement and interpret

**TF-IDF Semantic Scoring:**
- ✅ Captures word overlap
- ❌ Misses semantic nuance
- ❌ Sensitive to vocabulary mismatch

**What's Needed:**
