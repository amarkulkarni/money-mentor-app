# Intent Routing Integration - Test Results ‚úÖ

## Overview

Successfully integrated **intelligent intent routing** into the `/api/chat` endpoint. The system now automatically routes queries to either:
- üßÆ **Calculator Agent** - For investment calculations
- üìö **RAG Pipeline** - For general financial questions

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `app/main.py`

**Added:**
- Import for calculator agent: `from agents import run_calculation_query`
- `tool` field to `ChatResponse` model: `tool: str = "rag"`
- Intent detection logic with keywords
- Automatic routing with fallback mechanism
- MoneyMentor branding on calculator responses

**Keywords that trigger calculator:**
```python
["invest", "investing", "monthly", "per month", 
 "compound", "annuity", "save", "saving",
 "how much will i have", "future value", "per year"]
```

### 2. Routing Logic

```
User Question
     ‚Üì
Contains calculation keywords?
     ‚Üì
    YES ‚Üí Try Calculator Agent
          ‚Üì
          Success? ‚Üí Return calculator result (tool: "calculator")
          ‚Üì
          Failed? ‚Üí Fall back to RAG (tool: "rag")
     ‚Üì
    NO ‚Üí Use RAG Pipeline (tool: "rag")
```

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Calculator Routing - Investment Calculation

**Query:**
```
"If I invest $500 monthly at 7% for 20 years, how much will I have?"
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "tool": "calculator",
  "model": "calculator_agent",
  "answer": "üí∞ **MoneyMentor Calculator**\n\nInvesting $500.00/month at 7.0% annual return for 20 years:\n‚Ä¢ Total contributions: $120,000.00\n‚Ä¢ Interest earned: $140,463.33\n‚Ä¢ Final value: $260,463.33\nYour money will grow 2.17x through compound interest!",
  "sources": [
    {
      "source": "financial_calculator",
      "text": "Calculated with parameters: {'monthly_contrib': 500.0, 'annual_rate': 7.0, 'years': 20}",
      "relevance_score": 1.0
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ Status:** Calculator routing works perfectly!

---

### ‚úÖ Test 2: RAG Routing - General Question

**Query:**
```
"What is compound interest?"
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "tool": "rag",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "answer": "Compound interest is a financial concept...",
  "sources": [5 sources from knowledge base]
}
```

**Routing log:**
```
üßÆ Routing to calculator agent
‚ö†Ô∏è  Calculator parsing failed, falling back to RAG
üìö Routing to RAG pipeline
‚úÖ RAG answer generated with 5 sources
```

**‚úÖ Status:** Fallback mechanism works! Calculator couldn't parse it, so RAG handled it.

---

### ‚úÖ Test 3: RAG Routing - Investment Question (No Calculation)

**Query:**
```
"How should I start investing?"
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "tool": "rag",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "answer": "Starting to invest involves several key steps: 1. Understand your financial goals...",
  "sources": [sources from knowledge base]
}
```

**Routing log:**
```
üßÆ Routing to calculator agent
‚ö†Ô∏è  Calculator parsing failed, falling back to RAG
üìö Routing to RAG pipeline
```

**‚úÖ Status:** Keyword "invest" triggered calculator check, but no numbers to parse, so RAG answered properly.

---

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Calculator Routing - Different Format

**Query:**
```
"Save $1000 per month at 8% for 30 years"
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "tool": "calculator",
  "model": "calculator_agent",
  "answer": "üí∞ **MoneyMentor Calculator**\n\nInvesting $1,000.00/month at 8.0% annual return for 30 years:\n‚Ä¢ Total contributions: $360,000.00\n‚Ä¢ Interest earned: $1,130,359.45\n‚Ä¢ Final value: $1,490,359.45\nYour money will grow 4.14x through compound interest!"
}
```

**‚úÖ Status:** Calculator handles various query formats!

---

## Response Structure

### Calculator Response:
```json
{
  "answer": "üí∞ **MoneyMentor Calculator**\n\n[explanation]",
  "sources": [{
    "source": "financial_calculator",
    "text": "Calculated with parameters: {...}",
    "relevance_score": 1.0
  }],
  "query": "user question",
  "model": "calculator_agent",
  "tool": "calculator"
}
```

### RAG Response:
```json
{
  "answer": "[GPT-4 generated answer]",
  "sources": [{
    "source": "document.txt",
    "chunk_id": 1,
    "score": 0.85,
    "text": "[chunk text]"
  }, ...],
  "query": "user question",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "tool": "rag"
}
```

---

## How to Distinguish Responses

### In Backend/Logs:
```python
if response['tool'] == 'calculator':
    print("Calculator was used")
elif response['tool'] == 'rag':
    print("RAG was used")
```

### In Frontend:
```typescript
// Check the tool field
if (data.tool === 'calculator') {
  // Show calculator icon or badge
  renderCalculatorBadge();
} else {
  // Show knowledge base icon
  renderKnowledgeBaseBadge();
}
```

---

## Testing Commands

### Test Calculator:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "If I invest $500 monthly at 7% for 20 years?"}' | jq '.tool'
# Output: "calculator"
```

### Test RAG:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is a budget?"}' | jq '.tool'
# Output: "rag"
```

### Test Fallback:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is compound interest?"}' | jq '.tool'
# Output: "rag" (keyword "compound" triggers calculator, but falls back)
```

---

## Performance

| Scenario | Response Time | Tool Used |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Calculator (successful) | ~2ms | Calculator |
| Calculator ‚Üí RAG fallback | ~2-3s | RAG |
| Direct RAG | ~2-3s | RAG |

**Calculator is 1000x faster** when it can parse the query! ‚ö°

---

## Edge Cases Handled

1. ‚úÖ **Keywords present, but no calculation** ‚Üí Falls back to RAG
2. ‚úÖ **Calculation possible** ‚Üí Uses calculator
3. ‚úÖ **No keywords** ‚Üí Goes straight to RAG
4. ‚úÖ **Ambiguous queries** ‚Üí Tries calculator, falls back gracefully
5. ‚úÖ **Various formats** ‚Üí Calculator handles many patterns

---

## Monitoring

**Check logs for routing decisions:**
```bash
tail -f moneymentor/fastapi_routing.log | grep -E "Routing|Calculator|RAG"
```

**Example output:**
```
üßÆ Routing to calculator agent
‚úÖ Calculator agent successful: $260,463.33

üìö Routing to RAG pipeline
‚úÖ RAG answer generated with 5 sources

üßÆ Routing to calculator agent
‚ö†Ô∏è  Calculator parsing failed, falling back to RAG
üìö Routing to RAG pipeline
```

---

## Frontend Integration (Next Steps)

### 1. Visual Indicators

Add badges to show which tool was used:

```typescript
// In MessageBubble.tsx
{message.tool === 'calculator' && (
  <span className="text-xs bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 px-2 py-1 rounded">
    üßÆ Calculator
  </span>
)}

{message.tool === 'rag' && (
  <span className="text-xs bg-green-100 text-green-800 px-2 py-1 rounded">
    üìö Knowledge Base
  </span>
)}
```

### 2. Update Types

```typescript
// In types.ts
export interface ChatResponse {
  answer: string;
  sources: Source[];
  query: string;
  model: string;
  tool: 'calculator' | 'rag';  // Add this field
}
```

### 3. Handle Responses

```typescript
// In App.tsx
const data: ChatResponse = await response.json();

const mentorMessage: Message = {
  id: (Date.now() + 1).toString(),
  role: 'mentor',
  content: data.answer,
  sources: data.sources,
  tool: data.tool,  // Pass through
  timestamp: new Date(),
};
```

## Success Criteria - All Met! ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Intent detection based on keywords
- ‚úÖ Automatic routing to calculator or RAG
- ‚úÖ `tool` field in response (`"calculator"` or `"rag"`)
- ‚úÖ MoneyMentor branding on calculator responses
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback mechanism
- ‚úÖ Unified JSON response format
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging
- ‚úÖ All test cases passing

---

## What's Different Now?

### Before:
- All questions ‚Üí RAG only
- Slow calculations (2-3 seconds)
- No specialized handling

### After:
- Smart routing based on intent
- Fast calculations (~2ms)
- Graceful fallback
- Clear indication of tool used
- Better user experience

---

## Example Usage in Production

### User asks: "If I save $200 monthly at 5% for 10 years?"

**Backend:**
1. Detects keywords: "save", "monthly"
2. Routes to calculator
3. Calculator parses: `$200/month, 5%, 10 years`
4. Calculates: `$31,056.46`
5. Returns with `tool: "calculator"`

**Response time:** ~2ms ‚ö°

**Frontend:**
1. Receives response with `tool: "calculator"`
2. Shows calculator badge
3. Displays formatted answer with MoneyMentor branding
4. Shows calculation parameters in sources

---

## Conclusion

‚ú® **Intent routing is live and working perfectly!**

The system now intelligently routes queries to the most appropriate tool, providing:
- **Fast** calculations when possible
- **Smart** fallback to RAG when needed
- **Clear** indication of which tool was used
- **Seamless** user experience

**Next:** Add visual indicators in the frontend to show users which tool answered their question!
